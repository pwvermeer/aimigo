    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Aimigo is on a mission to increase wellbeing, citizen participation and job satisfaction across Europe.
        We connect cutting-edge technology to social goals — especially for people facing vulnerable circumstances.
        We don’t see AI coaching as a replacement for human interaction. But we do know how high the barriers can be:
        long waiting lists, complex systems, or the emotional hurdle of asking for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aimigo lowers those thresholds. We activate people. We support them just enough to take their next step —
        and then we encourage them to go offline again, because the real magic happens outside, in the unexpected,
        in human contact.

    <!-- Our Roots and Reach -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Roots and Reach</h2>
      <p>
        Aimigo is a spin-off of the Dutch non-profit JobOn, with over 10 years of experience supporting jobseekers in their search for meaningful work.
        We believe that everyone has value. While Europe faces growing labour shortages, there’s still so much unused talent.
        Aimigo helps bridge this mismatch — by making people more proactive and better connected to opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently building a coalition of the willing: governments, partners and funders who share our mission.
        Let’s create accessible innovation together.
